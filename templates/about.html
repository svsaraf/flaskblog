Synesthesia is a neurological condition that reflects not only an interesting brain condition, but I would argue, a turning point for the realities of being human. Synesthesia classically is the blurring of cognitive pathways. People with this condition often see numbers as colors, or letters as musical notes. Sometimes these abilities are seen as an advantage (many math prodigies are synesthetes) while other times it is a handicap (also seen frequently in those with dyslexia). From a psychological perspective, synesthesia is interesting because of the implied neural networking that makes it possible. V.S. Ramachandran and others have demonstrated that synesthesia may be the result of an underlying mechanism that enables us to truly have a conceptual understanding of the world around us. There are many different kinds of synesthesia. The most common form is called grapheme, or color synesthesia. In this type, letters of the alphabet and numbers are shaded and tinged with a particular color. No two synesthetes claim the same numbers have the same colors, but the colors are internally consistent for a particular person. Various psychological studies have been done demonstrating that synesthetes are particularly sensitive to color changes in graphemes. In a grid containing 99.9% 5s and 0.1% 2s, synesthetes were more than five times faster than normal at pointing out the differing numbers. Another kind synesthesia is sound-color synesthesia. Apparently chromesthesia is “something like fireworks,” in which particular sounds can evoke color inputs in the person. Many musical composers (most prominently Rimsky-Korsakov, composer of “Flight of the Bumblebee”) were color synesthetes. The most interesting form of synesthesia is ordinal-lingusitic personification. That is, it attributes a particular personality to a number, letter, color, or sound. Some things are angry, others are suave, others are happy. Synesthesia is, in essence, the tying of one sensation to the experience of another. But this is not something that is unique to people with the disorder. Indeed, many people, if not most, do this tying together all the time. When a poet says, “the sea was as blue and cool, it outpoured the feeling of strength and of calm without showing the anger within” he’s using the gift of metaphor, the way we tie things together. Scientists have shown that synesthesia runs more strongly through families that produce poets, writers, musicians, and other creative professions. Our ability to see the truth of something in something else is, essentially, our ability to truly understand something. When we comprehend some concept, we are able to express that concept in terms of other, formerly unrelated ones. Researchers have found that synesthesia is produced by the literal crossing of neurons. The brain cells that stem from the understanding of sight get tied to logical reasoning of letters and numbers, and thus color synesthesia is created. Ramachandran and his work on the angular gyrus support this conclusion. Fundamentally, the crossings of neurons that allow for metaphor must also, he argues, be responsible for the formation of language. Language is that which represents a foreign concept – a letter, a number, a sound, a color, a person, etc. It has been hypothesized that language is what allowed humans to rise above other animals in terms of intellectual capacity and critical thinking. Indeed, perhaps it was synesthesia all along.
